Hello there!  
This is an inaugural post on the blog part of this site.

<!---->

These blogs are meant to be the compilation of what I have learnt and completed regarding any topic that comes my way and peaks interest high enough. You can expect this to contain occasional Computer Logic, Graphics, Computer Architecture based, some programming projects, concepts, or even Mathematical anecdotes that influenced me, and I feel it must be shared. I hope you enjoy it.  
Do [contact]({{site.baseurl}}/contact) me if you found something worthwhile here!
