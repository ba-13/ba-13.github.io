Hello there!  
This is an inaugural post on the blog part of this site.

<!---->

These blogs are meant to be the compilation of what I have learnt and completed regarding any topic that comes my way and peaks interest high enough. You can expect this to contain occasional Computer Logic based, Computer Architecture based, some programming projects, or even a few Mathematical concepts that fascinates me personally, and I feel it worthy of sharing with the world. I hope everyone enjoys it.  
Do contact me if you found something worthwhile here!
