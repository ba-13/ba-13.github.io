A friend, Sujal, asked me to help out at a problem statement on prediction. I don't know why people had the perception that people who dunno about DSA would be good at ML. Anyways, I did try it out, and submitted [this](https://github.com/ba-13/DS_Exploration/tree/main/IPL_Prediction). It was a short, but long 2 day problem statement.

EDIT: He did get an offer, but didn't get the prize. Shucks.
