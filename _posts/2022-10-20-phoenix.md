Aerial Robotics without a working drone? Can't do like that.

<!---->

My team Aerial was dying, and I had to do something. So in the mid-term vacation, I approached a PhD for guiding me to construct a drone, which I thought would motivate my other teammates to start working again. So by the end of the vacation, I built the Phoenix, with the constant guidance of that PhD, and he flew it the second day after vacation ended. I wasn't present that time, and the battery flew off, leading to a crash. The following days, we started working hard on completely fixing the drone, and made another one during the process. To be honest, it wasn't much of a mind-work compared to following procedures properly and knowing some heuristics. We were finally able to debug all problems and showcase 2 drones in the Pavillion'22, flying them in process. It's actually thrilling to fly a drone. You should try it out some day, so approach me for that. Again, it wasn't much of a brain-tingling task, so I'm not much satisfied with how much time it took, but it was worth it. The team seems to have a future, let's see.
