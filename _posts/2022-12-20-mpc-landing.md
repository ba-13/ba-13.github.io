This was a course project of CS637, which I did with 2 teammates, this time did everything on the last 2 days of submission, but with an active team.

We implemented a pipeline with a model predictive control and a three different methods to land on a moving platform. The simulation wasn't finally able to land, it kept on following the landing platform, but the whole pipeline creation cleared ROS for me. We learnt a tonne that night.
