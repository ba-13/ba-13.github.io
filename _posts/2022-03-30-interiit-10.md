The first meet was in Ashwin's room in Hall 1, where the seniors just said some terms that seemed vaguely familiar, and told us to implement them. Adit carried.

The problem statement was tackled by a group of 6 sophomores, four of us making the actual algorithm, two making an interface. We finally built JuX, a python package to filter and extract flare data from light curves data provided by Indian Space Research Organisation. The time spent in this was enormous, and led to my habit of waking up till 4. But the outcome was awesome despite a bit of messup on UI interface. You can find the whole structure [here](https://github.com/Jadit19/Inter-IIT-Tech-Meet-2022).
