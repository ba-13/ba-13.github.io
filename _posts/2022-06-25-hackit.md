Honestly, I myself haven't completed Microcorruption. It became evident that you can teach without even knowing. Yes I didn't get any positive feedback, I wasn't the greatest teacher.

I offered a cybersecurity based project during summers to Y21s. I had huge plans, and myself was trying them out if they seemed to work. To be honest, I don't have the gift or the skill of bugging out a running application yet, but I was getting decent at playing virtual CTFs. ~25 freshers were registered in this project through SnT Council, and ~8 lasted till the end. I tried to be consistent with them, but internship load along with a course had the better of me. Still they should have learnt a few things throughout. You can find the [Leaderboard](https://ba-13.github.io/HackIT_22/) and the [assignments](https://github.com/ba-13/HackIT_22) I gave.
