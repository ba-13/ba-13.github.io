This blogging manner seems infeasible.

<!---->

To be truthful, I tried starting multiple sequences of blogs in here, but all of them failed.  
I think this posting needs a revamp.  
So from now on, I would be posting a lot more, but much shorter blogs.  
Will see you around then.

## Post Idea

I heard from Prof. Saikat quote Richard Feynman, about remembering a theory through a very simple example.  
I'll also quote Feynman here

> ... And it’s rather complicated, technically, but I’ll give a rather simple, idealized example.

I think discussing some key simple examples on theories I learn would be nice to share
Note that coming up with an example that covers up at least most of the nuances of the theory is non-trivial!
