I got another chance to work in Inter IIT. This time was more hands-on, and there were a lot more hands.

<!---->

The problem this time was tackled by 4 juniors and 6 sophomores, a High Prep problem statement. We were tasked to create a communication link between a provided drone and our machines, send it MSP encoded packets, and use the same for implementing a position control using a single monocular webcam stuck on a ceiling. Use the same as well to control 2 drones simultaneously. We were meant to do all these in python. But we created a `C++` backend for parallel feedback processing, used sockets to communicate the same to our python controller at nearly the same rate of 54Hz, and used the controller and the protocol implemented above for handling the drone. More problems arose related to motor burnout and swarm single host connections, but those were taken care of. Our team finally attained sixth position, but our score went down in documentation and presentation, even though I still think it was clean enough.
