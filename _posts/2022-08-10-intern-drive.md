Focussed effort especially when deadlines are near has always been exhausting and satisfying.

Intern drive of our college lasted from 20th July to 7th August. It was one of the most hectic days here, giving tests all day long, uptill saturating and feeling weird without tests afterwards. I was practicing since 20th June, did ~200 questions on Interviewbit. I don't know, am not able to practice like others do, still, it was fun.
I learnt a lot about DSA, about programming and problem solving in general. Probability was also to be kept in touch with, and had to go through Puzzles and Statistics as well. I had been trying out CSES Problemset for a while before, and I tried continuing. I'm still not done with this.
