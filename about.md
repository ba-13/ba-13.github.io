Heyo! I am B. Anshuman, you can call me as either. I am a ~~professional~~ thinker.  
I'm currently a Sophomore, majoring in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.  
<u>Anything that is non-trivial, incites me</u>.

I am from Ranchi, Jharkhand (India), studied in Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali, and had invested my childhood in the narrow world I was in back then. Standards X was consumed in preparation of National Talent Search Exam (NTSE), while XI, XII went in the preparation of JEE which got me in IITK where I'm right now.

The last year has been quite a ride for me. Unlike several of my peers, all my journey began on the November of 2021, where I was exposed to the vast multitude of fields that are waiting to be explored. I was introduced to a variety, from starting out in Keyboard to working on autonomous aerial vehicles.

I especially love giving time to topics that bring out symmetries and constants in this rapidly changing world.
I try to do everything from the roots so as to clear my understandings about the topic in hand, but I also rely on pre-implemented and optimized concepts and frameworks frequently enough.

I've exposure of Web Development, Machine Learning, CTFs, Scripting, ROS, Blockchains and Cryptography till now.  
Apart from these, stargazing, writing well-documented code, photowalks and music (Beats, LoFi) interests me.

Even though, I admit, you won't notice me if I was sitting beside you on a bus.  
Please do [hit me](../contact/) if you want a chat, I love to hear what others have to say about why Deep Thought chose 42 as the answer, we can talk about the question as well.
