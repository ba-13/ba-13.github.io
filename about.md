Heyo! I am Anshuman Barnwal, earlier known as B. Anshuman; you can call me as either.
Currently a Senior, I am majoring in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur.  
Everything that is non-trivial, incites me.

> Your choices makes you non-trivial

I am from Ranchi, Jharkhand, studied in Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali, and had invested my childhood in checking out RPGs and FPV games, reading Dahl, being teachers favourite. Standard X was consumed in preparation of National Talent Search Exam (NTSE), while XI, XII went in the preparation of JEE which got me in IITK where I'm right now.

The fresher year had been a ride for me. All my technical journey began on the November of 2021, where I was exposed to the vast multitude of fields that were waiting. I was introduced to a variety, from starting out with the Keyboard to working on simulations of autonomous aerial vehicles.

I especially love giving time to topics that bring out symmetries and constants in this changing world.
I try to do everything from the roots so as to clear my understandings about the topic in hand, but don't be fooled, I readily work on pre-implemented and optimized frameworks frequently.

I've had exposure of Web Development, Machine Learning, CTFs, Scripting, Robot Operating System, Blockchains and Cryptography. Check out the projects tab for more on these.  
Apart from these, stargazing, photowalks, piloting drones, skateboarding and music (Beats, Electro) interests me.

Even though, I admit, you won't notice me if I was sitting beside you on a bus, or maybe you would, I know you're smart :D  
Please do [hit me](../contact/) if you want a chat, I love to hear what others have to say about why Deep Thought chose 42 as the answer, we can talk about the question as well.
