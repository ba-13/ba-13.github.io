<span style="font-size: 2rem;">H</span>eyo! My Name is Anshuman Barnwal, earlier known as B. Anshuman; You may call me either.  
Currently a Senior, I am majoring in `Electrical Engineering` from `IIT Kanpur`.  
I am famed to be curious, nerdy and too literal.

> I aspire to be creative, industrious and easy-going.

The moment you find I am not being one of them, ping me to earn a dollar!

I am from Ranchi, Jharkhand, studied in `Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali`, and had invested my childhood in playing out RPGs and FPV games, reading Dahl, and being stubborn. I spent my Standard X working for NTSE, while XI, XII went in the preparation of JEE which got me in IITK where I'm right now.

The fresher year had been a ride for me. All my technical journey began on the March of 2021, where I was exposed to the fields that were my unknown unknowns. I was introduced to a variety, from starting out with the Keyboard to working on simulations of autonomous aerial vehicles.

I especially love giving time to topics that bring out symmetries and constants in this changing world (aka relating topics with each other).
I try to do everything from the roots so as to clear my understanding, but I frequently use pre-implemented frameworks to get things done.

I have worked on Web Development, Machine Learning, CTFs, Scripting, Robot Operating System, Blockchains and Cryptography. Check out the [Projects](../projects/) tab for more on these.  
Apart from these, sunshine, stargazing, photowalks, piloting drones, skateboarding, music and running keeps me happy.

Please do [ping me](../contact/) if you want a chat, I would love to hear why you landed here.
