  <p>Hello there!<br />
This is an inaugural post on the blog part of this site.</p>

<!---->

<p>Despite being an academic for most of my life, I am good clay sculptor, like cooking and ice skating, and love table tennis and meeting people.</p>

<p>I was born and brought up in Ranchi, India; and had invested my childhood in playing RPGs and FPV games, reading Roald Dahl and Blyton, and being a nuisance. I used to make a refrigerator carton essentially my tree house (I was tiny!), where I used to be snug and unreachable with a blanket and a torch, and read on Kindle for days. I used to have a stick shaped as an Assault rifle, which also helped me climb walls and get into the terrace of my neighbors. There used to be a perfect high Moringa tree behind my home, branches of which I used to sit and watch below and above. School was great, I had a lot of time, made some forgone friends, just focus on understanding things, and everything was smooth.</p>

<p>Final three years of my schooling was different, I became competitive and isolated but with my mates at coaching, and the routine was set up of working for a fixed goal. Productive days. Then was the time I used to cut my own hair (terribly) to save time.</p>

<p>The fresher year had been a ride for me. All my technical journey began on the February 2021, where I was exposed to the fields that were my unknown unknowns. I was introduced to a variety, from starting out with the Keyboard to working on simulations of autonomous aerial vehicles. This continued with me indulging in topics that were being hyped around, and I would have a lot of things to do, despite having no outcomes.</p>

<p>These blogs are meant to be the compilation of what I have learnt and completed regarding any topic that comes my way and peaks interest high enough. You can expect this to contain occasional Computer Logic, Graphics, Computer Architecture based, some programming projects, concepts, or even Mathematical anecdotes that influenced me, and I feel it must be shared. I hope you enjoy it.<br />
Do <a href="/contact">contact</a> me if you found something worthwhile here!</p>
