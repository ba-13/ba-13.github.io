  Thanks for your time here, hope you found what you were looking for. <br />
  You're always invited at my actual residence, right now that is <b>H211 - Hall 9, IIT Kanpur</b>. <br />
  I realise that forms as below are a bit boring to fill, but these are not unlike small talks... the initiators to
  <b>greater conversations</b> ahead! <br />
