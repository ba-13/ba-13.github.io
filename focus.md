Hey, it seems you were trying to detour from your work. Why is that?

- Are you tired? Have something sweet else nap.
- Are you sad? Meet someone you like.
- Do you want a change? Switch to the next goal's task.

Remember what you want to be:

|     | Wannabe                          | Rough ToDo                                    |
| --- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 0.  | A great storyteller              | Read and remember, Talk to people             |
| 1.  | A brilliant problem-solver       | Solve maths and computational coding problems |
| 2.  | A sky-diver                      | Visit Gym and Play in court                   |
| 3.  | A Ph.D. with a field you created | Read papers and learn about your field        |

You are on the path of becoming each of them, but you are not there yet.
